Summary:
- show single binary setup of Terraform: HCL processing & Engine
- show double binary setup of Pulumi: Language Host & Engine
- indicate that the chosen language (imperative or not) doesn't have any implications of the engine remaining declarative
- we chose a gRPC protocol, rather than an in-process call to request creation of resources to the engine
- the provisioning magic happens in the engine & the providers
- now comes the nifty part
- with this separation, Pulumi brings cloud engineering closer to developers
- we allow for components (Pulumi Packages) to be written in any language given a component is a resource by itself.
- we allow for policies to be written with the same ease as abstractions.
- we mix it all in a single setup

On a weekly basis, articles and tweets pass by discussing whether or not some specific tool is imperative or declarative.
It's no surprise that Pulumi is often the tool being debated. What if I tell you that Pulumi is imperative, declarative and imperative?

<!--more-->

When we look at our [Frequently Asked Questions](/docs/support/faq/#is-pulumi-imperative-or-declarative), we read the following on the declarative versus imperative topic:

> Pulumi is a declarative tool that uses imperative languages to define your end state. The language is used for authoring your program.
> Itâ€™s not used for talking to the cloud provider API.

The title of the article mentions `imperative` and `declarative` both. Pulumi leverages the best of both worlds
into our product.

Pulumi tries to offer a solution where our customers are only limited by their imagination rather than the tool at hand.
Let me use the Pulumi architecture to highlight why I mention *imperative* twice.

## Pulumi Architecture

If you don't know the Pulumi architecture, here is the diagram from our [How Pulumi Works](/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/) page:

![Pulumi Architecture](/images/docs/reference/engine-block-diagram.png)

### Language Host

TL;DR Imperative, no doubt!

### CLI and Engine

TL;DR Imperative, non-negotiable!

### Providers

TL;DR Imperative, no doubt!

Either way, avoid using images or code samples [in the first 70 words](https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/#automatic-summary-splitting) of your post, as these may not render properly in summary contexts (e.g., on the blog home page or in social-media previews).
